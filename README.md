## I'm a Software Engineering Student on his last year of bachelor's. (Finishing on Dec-2024).

# I learned english by myself (with guidance of youtubers, podcast, different kind of websites, books and topics like Psychology, Technology, and more).

# As you can see, i'm learning on how to use Git and Github properly, and improving my development skills with everything that I can, searching and researching information as i did with my process of english learning.
